# CanvasDrawingTool-master
This is now an outdated old version of CCL (Canvas Control Library) reimplementation to make some tutorial videos for Udemy.com to try and make some money for myself.
Technology has moved on quite a bit and hence I am releasing this to the public domain as it is not of much use to me in the way of making myself any money to pay my bills. Will possibly give more information or not.
I do not have any plans for anything.
